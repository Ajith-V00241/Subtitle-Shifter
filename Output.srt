1
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,525
Tyrion: Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,606
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

3
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,178
your father gave the order.

4
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,804
The Lannisters aren't
the only ones who pay their debts.

5
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:21,157
Ser Dontos.

6
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:23,779
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

7
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:25,816
I'm a living fool,
thanks to you.

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,420
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,023
You have your child bride.

10
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,095
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

11
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:37,282
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm Jojen Reed.

13
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,768
This is my sister, Lira.

14
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,690
We've come a long way
to find you Brandon.

15
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,334
You're a warg.
It's in your blood.

16
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:50,498
I don't want you talking to him
anymore, until we get to Castle Black.

17
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:51,729
We're not going to Castle Black.

18
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:53,735
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

19
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,555
I am the cause for bringing
Melisandre to us.

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,869
She gave you a son.

21
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,233
I gave you nothing.

22
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:06,414
That's not true.

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,093
I want to see my daughter.

24
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,580
I'm marrying
my eldest son

25
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,833
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden.

26
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:17,888
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

27
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,744
Ser Jaime Lannister.

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,543
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

29
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:24,230
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

30
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,693
Makes for more of a contest.

31
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,050
Winterfel's in ruins.

32
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,078
What happened up there?

33
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,499
I heard the Greyjoy boys
seized the place.

34
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,047
I sent my bastard
Ramsey to root them out.

35
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:34,395
Please.

36
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,262
What

37
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,437
is your name?

38
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:40,991
Reek.

Down.

Well done.
You, too.

70
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:03,680
I only wounded her.

71
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,698
You brought her down.
That's what matters.

72
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,400
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

73
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,602
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

74
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:12,871
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

75
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,507
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

It will be over soon.

77

She thinks
she's pretty.

00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,282
Let me put one
through her face.

We have to reward
the hounds, love.

80

They did all
the hard work.

81
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,288
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

82
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,056
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

83
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,993
- Me jealous of her?
- <i>My lord, please.</i>

84
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:37,229
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

Tyrion: <i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

91
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,090
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

92
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,192
Is it solid gold?

93
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:10,229
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

94
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:12,164
Why is no one eating?

95
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,967
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

96
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,036
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

97
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,338
not a stomach.

98
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,173
Try the boar.

99
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:24,209
Cersei can't get enough
of it since one killed Robert for her.

100
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:27,479
A toast.

101
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:30,883
To the proud
Lannister children.

102
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,786
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,454
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

104
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:37,489
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

105
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:42,628
It's only wine.

106
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,672
I can't fight anymore.

107
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,374
What about your left?

108
00:06:56,843 --> 00:07:00,212
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

109
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,314
How can I
protect the king

110
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,049
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

111
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:06,685
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

112
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,621
Let others
do the fighting.

113
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:12,825
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

114
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,260
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

115
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,429
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

116
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:20,699
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

117
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,103
With whom? You?
Men talk.

118
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:26,672
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

119
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:32,244
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

120
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:35,914
As it happens,
I have just the one.

121
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:47,726
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,695
Unusual talent
for a sellsword.

123
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,897
He tells me
you shit gold

124
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,766
just like your father.

125
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,668
Is this place safe?

126
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:01,206
There's this knight,
Leygood,

127
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,842
- got thunderbolts on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

128
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,378
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

129
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,714
She's a screamer,
that one.

130
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:11,483
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

131
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,721
( whistles ) I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

132
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:18,123
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

133
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,492
if you fight with
an edged blade,

134
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,694
I'll have to.

135
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,163
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

136
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,632
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

137
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,367
( blade clatters )

138
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,769
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

139
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,309
Ah!

140
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:40,646
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

141
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,981
Best time
to attack a man.

142
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,019
Mind yourself.

143
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:51,423
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

144
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,839
Come on, then.

145
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:21,053
Man:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

146
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,990
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

147
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,928
( horse whinnies )

148
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,475
Man: <i>Let's get these</i>
<i>horses seen to!</i>

149
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:47,946
Father.
Welcome home.

150
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:52,084
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

151
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,186
A pleasure, Mother.

152
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,255
Hello.

153
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,957
Roose: <i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

154
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:02,294
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

155
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,363
This way, my lady.

156
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,465
Where is your prize?

157
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,100
With the hounds.

158
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,737
I'll have a look at him.

159
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,378
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

160
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,180
Word travels.
How he screamed.

161
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:24,716
- You would have loved it.
- ( laughs )

162
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,861
Father.

163
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,171
What did you
do to him?

164
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,272
I trained him.

165
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:50,542
He was a slow learner,
but he learned.

166
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:53,178
You flayed him.

167
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,580
Peeled a few bits.

168
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,549
Removed a few others.

169
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,454
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

170
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,890
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

171
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,992
The flayed man
is on our banners.

172
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:08,860
My banners,
not yours.

173
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:10,896
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,102
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

175
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,638
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

176
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,540
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

177
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:23,775
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

178
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,079
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

179
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:30,549
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

180
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,384
I already asked.

181
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:35,887
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no--

182
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,924
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

183
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,026
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

184
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,527
I acted.

185
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:51,169
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

186
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,004
thanks to the Greyjoys.

187
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,006
I needed Theon.

188
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,975
I needed him whole.

189
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,479
Theon was our enemy.

190
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,514
But Reek,

191
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,384
Reek will never
betray us.

192
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:09,121
I placed far too much
trust in you.

193
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,800
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

194
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:25,303
- <i>It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

195
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,608
Give him the razor.

196
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,719
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

197
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,395
Go on, Reek.

198
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,864
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

199
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:16,588
Reek, tell Father

200
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:19,658
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

201
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:21,726
I don't know,
my lord.

202
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,495
You murdered them

203
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,299
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

204
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,769
Ramsay: <i>Reek,</i>

205
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:33,038
did you murder
the Stark boys?

206
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,240
No, my lord.

207
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,541
Just two farm boys.

208
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,544
Ramsay: <i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

209
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,214
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

210
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:46,718
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

211
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,421
If Bran and Rickon
are alive,

212
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,023
the country will rally
to their side

213
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:54,259
now that
Robb Stark is gone.

214
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,297
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

215
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,767
Robb Stark is dead.

216
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,537
<i>Sorry.</i>

217
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,839
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

218
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:10,809
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

219
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:16,248
How do you feel
about that?

220
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:32,130
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

221
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,400
Find those boys and I'll give you
1,000 acres and a holdfast.

222
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,469
Your pet rat
have any thoughts

223
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,704
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

224
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,875
Jon Snow is at
Castle Black.

225
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,245
Who the fuck
is Jon Snow?

226
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,647
Their bastard brother.

227
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,949
He could be
sheltering them.

228
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,551
He may know
where they are.

229
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,656
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

230
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,324
Could be a threat.

231
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,493
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

232
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,096
Gather whatever
men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.

233
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,365
Bring this creature
of yours.

234
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,702
Maybe he'll be
of some use.

235
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,140
Take the Moat
for the family,

236
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:16,841
for <i>our</i> family,

237
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,377
and I'll reconsider
your position.

238
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,917
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

239
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:29,220
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

240
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:32,057
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

241
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,225
Shae has been noticed.

242
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,727
Sansa's maid
saw you with her.

243
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,462
She already told
your sister.

244
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,731
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

245
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,934
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

246
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,736
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

247
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,438
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

248
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,173
No, I will not.

249
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:51,476
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

250
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,845
if they suspected
me of lying?

251
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,281
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

252
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,350
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

253
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:00,819
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

254
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,621
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

255
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,690
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

256
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:08,860
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

257
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,395
She won't leave.

258
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,696
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

259
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:13,632
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

260
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,635
Your father has promised
to hang the next whore he finds you with.

261
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,205
Have you ever known
your father to make an idle threat?

262
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:25,410
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

263
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,648
Your Grace, it is my honor to present you
with this wedding cup.

264
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:32,217
May you
and my daughter Margaery

265
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,052
drink deep
and live long.

266
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:36,488
A handsome goblet,
my lord.

267
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,157
Or shall I call
you Father?

268
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,726
I shall be honored,
Your Grace.

269
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:51,469
She's the whore
I told you about.

270
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:53,304
The dark-haired one.

271
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,976
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

272
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,821
A book?

273
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,290
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

274
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,626
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

275
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,130
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

276
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:20,865
A book every king
should read.

277
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,043
Now that the war is won,

278
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:35,246
we should all find
time for wisdom.

279
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,516
Thank you, Uncle.

280
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:52,797
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

281
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:56,735
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

282
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:13,551
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

283
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,854
So they say.

284
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,930
( panting )

285
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,467
Such a great sword
should have a name.

286
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:32,303
- What shall I call her?
- Man: <i>Stormbringer.</i>

287
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,472
- Man #2: <i>Terminus.</i>
- Man #3: <i>Widow's Wail.</i>

288
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:37,008
- Man #4: <i>Wolfsbane.</i>
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

289
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,344
( chuckles )

290
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,412
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

291
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,081
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

292
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,105
<i>( door opens )</i>

293
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,344
Don't.

294
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:17,415
You want me on the desk?

295
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:23,087
- <i>What's wrong, my lion?</i>
- Don't call me that.

296
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,824
What should I call you?

297
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:28,793
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

298
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,595
Our friendship?

299
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,997
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

300
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,233
What?

301
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,701
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

302
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:41,105
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

303
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:43,808
What is this?

304
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,044
I'm a married man.

305
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,947
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

306
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,116
<i>I don't want her to suffer anymore</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

307
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,319
I need to uphold my vows.

308
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,988
She doesn't want you.

309
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,657
- <i>I need to do right by her.</i>
- You don't want her.

310
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,392
By our children.

311
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,763
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

312
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:09,200
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

313
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,916
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

314
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:14,939
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

315
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:17,308
- Shae.
- We will fight them together.

316
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,711
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

317
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:21,846
You're a whore!

318
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,085
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

319
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,587
I can't be in love
with a whore.

320
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:32,023
I can't have children
with a whore.

321
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,759
How many men
have you been with?

322
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:37,028
500? 5,000?

323
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:45,336
How many whores
have you been with?

324
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,505
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

325
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,641
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

326
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:51,976
But now that time
is over.

327
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,849
<i>( Shae crying )</i>

328
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,962
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

329
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:15,833
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

330
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,753
<i>( door closes )</i>

331
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,795
- <i>( woman screaming )</i>
- Melisandre: Hear us now.

332
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,397
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

333
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,366
and lead us
from the darkness.

334
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,934
( crying )

335
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,637
Sire, I served you well.

336
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,606
<i>( crowd chanting )</i>
<i>Lord of Light, show us the way...</i>

337
00:21:55,641 --> 00:22:00,044
Selyse, you're my sister!

338
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,612
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

339
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:04,248
Tell him!
Tell him!

340
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,252
<i>for the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

341
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,655
( screaming )

342
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,867
Did you see?
Their souls.

343
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:25,836
It was their souls.

344
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:28,906
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

345
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,482
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

346
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,784
He was an infidel.

347
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,287
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

348
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,489
and their fathers
before him.

349
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:48,158
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

350
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:50,494
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

351
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:51,962
He disobeyed.

352
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,298
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

353
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,599
How many men?

354
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:58,002
A good deal
more than you.

355
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:01,272
Did you see,
Ser Davos?

356
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:02,606
They're with
our lord now.

357
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,175
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

358
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,878
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

359
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:22,126
( sniffs )

360
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,894
Meat's off.

361
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:27,631
Our larders
are almost empty.

362
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,700
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

363
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,302
You hate fish.

364
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:34,138
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

365
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:39,543
When Storm's End
was under siege and I was starving,

366
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:43,681
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

367
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,784
The binding glue
is made from horses.

368
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:54,358
One morning, he shot two seagulls
on the beach.

369
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:58,062
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

370
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:01,832
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

371
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,071
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

372
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:09,306
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child</i>

373
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,508
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

374
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:14,078
Until he found me.

375
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:23,220
I fear for
our daughter's soul.

376
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,790
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

377
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,959
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

378
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,095
You barely know her.

379
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:33,998
You think she's sweet
because she smiles when you visit.

380
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,300
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

381
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:39,370
Why else would the Lord of Light have
seen fit to mark her face?

382
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:40,904
She needs the rod.

383
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,408
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

384
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,478
As you command.

385
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:51,949
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

386
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:58,255
<i>( knocks )</i>

387
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,358
Come in.

388
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:05,829
Were you sleeping,
Princess?

389
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:12,803
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

390
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:15,239
I heard it.

391
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:16,874
And it frightened you?

392
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:18,776
Ser Axel was my uncle.

393
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,078
<i>He was always</i>
<i>kind to me.</i>

394
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,080
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

395
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:25,949
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

396
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,584
But they screamed.

397
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,620
Women scream
when they give birth.

398
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,256
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

399
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,957
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

400
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,993
You have so many
questions, don't you?

401
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,228
<i>So did I</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

402
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,597
I was much like you.

403
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,233
Only I wasn't a princess.

404
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,835
And you didn't have this.

405
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:46,737
No.

406
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,673
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

407
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,109
What do you know
of the gods?

408
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,411
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

409
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:57,214
Lies and fables.

410
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,284
Septons speak
of seven gods.

411
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:01,885
There are but two--

412
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,288
a god of light
and love and joy

413
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:07,958
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

414
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:09,727
Eternally at war.

415
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:13,764
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

416
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,534
There's only one hell,
Princess.

417
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,738
The one we live in now.

418
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:23,474
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

419
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:50,267
<i>( growls )</i>

420
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,941
- <i>Hodor.</i>
- ( breathing heavily )

421
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:03,247
Why did you wake me?

422
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:06,216
You've been gone
for hours.

423
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,885
I was hungry.

424
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,987
We're all hungry.

425
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,722
I was just eating.

426
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,792
Summer was eating.

427
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,795
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

428
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:20,964
<i>Spending too much time</i>
<i>in Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

429
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,334
You're not
a direwolf, Bran.

430
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:29,273
Must be glorious, though.

431
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:32,976
To run, to leap,
to hunt.

432
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:35,979
To be whole.

433
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:38,782
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

434
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,084
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

435
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,986
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

436
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,092
You'd forget us, Bran.

437
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,028
You'd forget your mother
and father.

438
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:53,063
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

439
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:54,832
You'd forget Winterfell.

440
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,767
You'd forget you.

441
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,938
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

442
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:06,743
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

443

<i>( wolf barks )</i>

444
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:35,639
Hodor, take me
to the tree.

445
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,610

Voice:
<i>...beneath the tree.</i>

449
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:39,036
- Cersei: <i>He saw us.</i>

( gasps )

453
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,019
I know where
we have to go.

454
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,789
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

455
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:46,470
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

456
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:50,374
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

457
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:54,244
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

<i>Cursed be he</i>

459
00:30:56,948 --> 00:31:00,183
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

460
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:06,656
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

461
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,928
( applause )

462
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:30,080
We have a new queen.

463
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,017
Better her than you.

464
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:49,132
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

465
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,302
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

466
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:54,771
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

467
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,406
tend not to have it
for long.

468
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:59,643
You ought to try
enjoying something before you die.

469
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,244
You might find
it suits you.

470
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,915
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

471
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,384
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

472
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,785
I'm paying my share.

473
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,121
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

474
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:12,823
to commemorate
your generosity?

475
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:16,326
No, your heartfelt
thank-you is its own reward.

476
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,329
I would imagine I'd be hearing it
again before long.

477
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,531
Wars are rather expensive.

478
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,568
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

479
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:27,337
How they love
to remind everyone.

480
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:30,040
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

481
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,042
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

482
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,644
We both know
you're smarter than that.

483
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,782
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

484
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,420
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( people laughing, chatting )

485
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,496
All taken care of.

486
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,465
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

487
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,367
You saw the ship
sail away?

488
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:01,037
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

489
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:02,973
How do you know?

490
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,542
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

491
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:07,310
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

492
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,446
There's someone
following you?

493
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,849
She's gone.

494
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:15,218
I know you don't
want to believe it, but she is.

495
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:18,588
Now, go drink till it
feels like you did the right thing.

496
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,796
Hello.

497
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:29,332
- Hello.
- Not you.

498
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,617
You look
exquisite, child.

499
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,954
The wind has been
at you, though.

500
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,090
I haven't had
the opportunity to tell you

501
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,893
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

502
00:33:56,928 --> 00:34:00,463
War is war, but killing a man
at a wedding,

503
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,065
horrid.

504
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:04,334
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

505
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:07,837
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

506
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,372
My lady.
My lady.

507
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:12,676
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

508
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,377
Perhaps if
your pauper husband

509
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:16,947
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

510
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,283
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

511
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:23,353
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

512
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,455
it would do you good
to see some of it.

513
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,458
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

514
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:30,594
some of this food
I paid for.

515
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:37,133
♪ A coat of gold ♪

516
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,836
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

517
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:45,742
<i>♪ A lion</i>
<i>still has claws ♪</i>

518
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:48,211
♪ And mine,
my lord... ♪

519
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:50,680
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

520
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,516
- ( coins clatter )
- ( crowd laughs )

521
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:10,133
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

522
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:12,669
( taps goblet )

523
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:14,271
Everyone.

524
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:18,108
The queen would like
to say a few words.

525
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:21,544
( applause )

526
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,484
We are so fortunate

527
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:29,753
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

528
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,289
Not all among us
are so lucky.

529
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:36,259
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

530
00:35:36,294 --> 00:35:39,596
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

531
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,333
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

532
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:46,603
- ( applause )
- <i>( music playing )</i>

533
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:57,247
You're an example
to us all.

534
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,498
Ser Jaime,
I'm very sorry.

535
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:17,200
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

536
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:21,938
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

537
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,506
Loras:
<i>As does yours.</i>

538
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,609
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

539
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,978
Yes, very much.

540
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:31,381
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

541
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,916
They certainly are.

542
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,217
Perhaps they should
get married.

543
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:36,386
( laughs )

544
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,855
If you were
to marry Cersei,

545
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,490
she'd murder you
in your sleep.

546
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:44,227
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

547
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:46,396
she'd murder him, too,

548
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,131
long before he drew
his first breath.

549
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,267
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

550
00:36:51,302 --> 00:36:53,903
because you'll never
marry her.

551
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,875
And neither will you.

552
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,557
Your Grace.
My king.

553
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,459
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

554
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:18,762
So good of you to come.

555
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:20,230
I'm no lady,
Your Grace.

556
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:22,665
Did you just bow?

557
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,167
Apologies, Your Grace.

558
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,936
I never did master
the curtsy.

559
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,571
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

560
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:31,574
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

561
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:33,309
A shame.

562
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,979
I'd knight the man that put an end
to that deviant's life.

563
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,282
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

564
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:40,683
and wish you good fortune.

565
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,619
The country has been
at war too long.

566
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:45,889
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

567
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,724
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

568
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,959
I hope we see
more of you.

569
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,802
Lady Brienne.

570
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,671
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

571
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,674
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

572
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,976
As you say, Your Grace.

573
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,445
I owe you my gratitude.

574
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:10,780
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

575
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,618
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

576
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,387
More than once.

577
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,522
Did he?

578
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,192
Haven't heard
that story before.

579
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,396
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

580
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,798
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

581
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:32,936
Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

582
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,473
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

583
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:39,275
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

584
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,845
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

585
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:44,013
But you love him.

586
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:53,990
Your Grace.

587
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:08,571
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

588
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,874
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

589
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:13,076
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice--

590
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,811
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

591
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:17,947
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

592
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:21,384
Brought shame on the Citadel with his
repugnant experiments.

593
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:23,753
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

594
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:26,155
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

595
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,992
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

596
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:31,106
What do you think
I could do to you if you annoyed me?

597
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:33,096
I never meant
to annoy anyone.

598
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,032
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

599
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:38,234
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

600
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,769
So here's what I want
you to do.

601
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:41,337
I want you to leave
my presence.

602
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:42,805
Leave this wedding
right now.

603
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,474
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

604
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,944
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

605
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,213
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery--

606
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,582
The <i>queen</i> is telling you

607
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:54,884
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

608
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,153
or you will.

609
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,975
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

610
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,244
( crowd laughing )

611
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:32,789
You're in rather
a good mood.

612
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:35,124
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

613
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,361
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

614
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,929
Prince Oberyn.

615
00:40:39,964 --> 00:40:41,297
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

616
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:43,066
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

617
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,501
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

618
00:40:45,536 --> 00:40:48,237
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

619
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:51,674
Lord Hand
and Lady Cersei,

620
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:55,745
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

621
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,480
Charmed.

622
00:40:57,514 --> 00:40:59,682
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

623
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:05,054
We are everywhere in Dorne.

624
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,423
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

625
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,892
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

626
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,327
We don't despise them
in Dorne.

627
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:12,562
No?
How tolerant of you.

628
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,631
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

629
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,367
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

630
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:20,536
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

631
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,572
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

632
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,540
It's a shame your older brother couldn't
attend the wedding.

633
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:26,909
Please give him
our regards.

634
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:28,678
With any luck,
the gout will abate

635
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:30,346
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

636
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:32,281
They call it
the rich man's disease.

637
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:33,683
A wonder
you don't have it.

638
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,585
Noblemen in my part
of the country

639
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,688
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

640
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:40,590
People everywhere
have their differences.

641
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,826
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

Though you're not
