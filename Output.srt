1
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:05,695
Tyrion: Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:07,776
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,348
your father gave the order.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,974
The Lannisters aren't
the only ones who pay their debts.

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:13,327
Ser Dontos.

6
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:15,949
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,986
I'm a living fool,
thanks to you.

8
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,590
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

9
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,193
You have your child bride.

10
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:24,265
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

11
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,452
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

12
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,030
I'm Jojen Reed.

13
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:33,938
This is my sister, Lira.

14
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:35,860
We've come a long way
to find you Brandon.

15
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,504
You're a warg.
It's in your blood.

16
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,668
I don't want you talking to him
anymore, until we get to Castle Black.

17
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:43,899
We're not going to Castle Black.

18
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:45,905
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

19
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,725
I am the cause for bringing
Melisandre to us.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,039
She gave you a son.

21
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,403
I gave you nothing.

22
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:58,584
That's not true.

23
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,263
I want to see my daughter.

24
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,750
I'm marrying
my eldest son

25
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:07,003
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden.

26
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:10,058
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

27
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,914
Ser Jaime Lannister.

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,713
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

29
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,400
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

30
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,863
Makes for more of a contest.

31
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,220
Winterfel's in ruins.

32
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,248
What happened up there?

33
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,669
I heard the Greyjoy boys
seized the place.

34
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,217
I sent my bastard
Ramsey to root them out.

35
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:26,565
Please.

36
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:27,432
What

37
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:30,607
is your name?

38
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,161
Reek.

Down.

00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,098
Well done.
You, too.

70
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:55,850
I only wounded her.

71
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,868
You brought her down.
That's what matters.

72
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:00,570
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

73
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:02,772
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

74
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:05,041
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

75
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,677
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

It will be over soon.

77

She thinks
she's pretty.

00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,452
Let me put one
through her face.

79

We have to reward
the hounds, love.

80
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,922
They did all
the hard work.

81
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,458
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

82
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,226
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

83
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,163
- Me jealous of her?
- <i>My lord, please.</i>

84
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:29,399
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

Tyrion: <i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,260
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

92
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,362
Is it solid gold?

93
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:02,399
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

94
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,334
Why is no one eating?

95
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:07,137
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

96
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,206
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,508
not a stomach.

98
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,343
Try the boar.

99
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:16,379
Cersei can't get enough
of it since one killed Robert for her.

100
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,649
A toast.

101
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:23,053
To the proud
Lannister children.

102
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:25,956
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

103
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,624
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

104
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,659
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

105
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,798
It's only wine.

106
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,842
I can't fight anymore.

107
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,544
What about your left?

108
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:52,382
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

109
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,484
How can I
protect the king

110
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,219
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

111
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:58,855
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

112
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,791
Let others
do the fighting.

113
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:04,995
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

114
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,430
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

115
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:09,599
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

116
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,869
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

117
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:16,273
With whom? You?
Men talk.

118
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,842
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

119
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,414
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

120
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:28,084
As it happens,
I have just the one.

121
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,896
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

122
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,865
Unusual talent
for a sellsword.

123
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,067
He tells me
you shit gold

124
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,936
just like your father.

125
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,838
Is this place safe?

126
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,376
There's this knight,
Leygood,

127
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,012
- got thunderbolts on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

128
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,548
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

129
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:00,884
She's a screamer,
that one.

130
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,653
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

131
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:07,891
( whistles ) I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

132
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:10,293
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

133
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:12,662
if you fight with
an edged blade,

134
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,864
I'll have to.

135
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,333
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

136
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,802
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

137
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,537
( blade clatters )

138
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,939
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

139
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,479
Ah!

140
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:32,816
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

141
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,151
Best time
to attack a man.

142
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,189
Mind yourself.

143
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,593
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

144
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,009
Come on, then.

145
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,223
Man:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

146
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,160
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

147
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:22,098
( horse whinnies )

148
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,645
Man: <i>Let's get these</i>
<i>horses seen to!</i>

149
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:40,116
Father.
Welcome home.

150
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:44,254
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

151
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,356
A pleasure, Mother.

152
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,425
Hello.

153
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,127
Roose: <i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

154
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:54,464
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

155
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:56,533
This way, my lady.

156
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,635
Where is your prize?

157
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,270
With the hounds.

158
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,907
I'll have a look at him.

159
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,548
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

160
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:14,350
Word travels.
How he screamed.

161
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:16,886
- You would have loved it.
- ( laughs )

162
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,031
Father.

163
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,341
What did you
do to him?

164
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,442
I trained him.

165
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,712
He was a slow learner,
but he learned.

166
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:45,348
You flayed him.

167
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,750
Peeled a few bits.

168
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,719
Removed a few others.

169
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,624
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

170
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,060
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

171
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,162
The flayed man
is on our banners.

172
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,030
My banners,
not yours.

173
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,066
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

174
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,272
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

175
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,808
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

176
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:13,710
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

177
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,945
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

178
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,249
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

179
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:22,719
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

180
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,554
I already asked.

181
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:28,057
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no--

182
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:31,094
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

183
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:33,196
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

184
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,697
I acted.

185
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,339
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

186
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:45,174
thanks to the Greyjoys.

187
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,176
I needed Theon.

188
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,145
I needed him whole.

189
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:52,649
Theon was our enemy.

190
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,684
But Reek,

191
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:57,554
Reek will never
betray us.

192
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:01,291
I placed far too much
trust in you.

193
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,970
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

194
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:17,473
- <i>It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

195
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,778
Give him the razor.

196
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,889
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

197
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,565
Go on, Reek.

198
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,034
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

199
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,758
Reek, tell Father

200
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,828
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

201
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,896
I don't know,
my lord.

202
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,665
You murdered them

203
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,469
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

204
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:22,939
Ramsay: <i>Reek,</i>

205
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,208
did you murder
the Stark boys?

206
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:27,410
No, my lord.

207
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:28,711
Just two farm boys.

208
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:31,714
Ramsay: <i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

209
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,384
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

210
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:38,888
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

211
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:41,591
If Bran and Rickon
are alive,

212
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,193
the country will rally
to their side

213
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,429
now that
Robb Stark is gone.

214
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,467
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

215
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:54,937
Robb Stark is dead.

216
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,707
<i>Sorry.</i>

217
00:13:57,741 --> 00:14:00,009
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

218
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:02,979
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

219
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:08,418
How do you feel
about that?

220
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:24,300
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

221
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:27,570
Find those boys and I'll give you
1,000 acres and a holdfast.

222
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,639
Your pet rat
have any thoughts

223
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,874
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

224
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:36,045
Jon Snow is at
Castle Black.

225
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,415
Who the fuck
is Jon Snow?

226
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,817
Their bastard brother.

227
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:43,119
He could be
sheltering them.

228
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,721
He may know
where they are.

229
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:49,826
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

230
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,494
Could be a threat.

231
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,663
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

232
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:57,266
Gather whatever
men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.

233
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,535
Bring this creature
of yours.

234
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:02,872
Maybe he'll be
of some use.

235
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:07,310
Take the Moat
for the family,

236
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:09,011
for <i>our</i> family,

237
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:11,547
and I'll reconsider
your position.

238
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:18,087
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

239
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:21,390
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

240
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:24,227
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

241
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,395
Shae has been noticed.

242
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,897
Sansa's maid
saw you with her.

243
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:29,632
She already told
your sister.

244
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,901
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

245
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:35,104
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

246
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,906
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

247
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,608
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

248
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,343
No, I will not.

249
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:43,646
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

250
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,015
if they suspected
me of lying?

251
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,451
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

252
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,520
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

253
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:52,989
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

254
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,791
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

255
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,860
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

256
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:01,030
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

257
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,565
She won't leave.

258
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,866
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

259
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,802
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

260
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:08,805
Your father has promised
to hang the next whore he finds you with.

261
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,375
Have you ever known
your father to make an idle threat?

262
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,580
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

263
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:21,818
Your Grace, it is my honor to present you
with this wedding cup.

264
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,387
May you
and my daughter Margaery

265
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,222
drink deep
and live long.

266
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,658
A handsome goblet,
my lord.

267
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,327
Or shall I call
you Father?

268
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,896
I shall be honored,
Your Grace.

269
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:43,639
She's the whore
I told you about.

270
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,474
The dark-haired one.

271
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:50,146
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

272
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:01,991
A book?

273
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,460
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

274
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,796
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

275
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,300
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

276
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:13,035
A book every king
should read.

277
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,213
Now that the war is won,

278
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:27,416
we should all find
time for wisdom.

279
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,686
Thank you, Uncle.

280
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:44,967
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

281
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:48,905
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

282
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:05,721
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

283
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:08,024
So they say.

284
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,100
( panting )

285
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,637
Such a great sword
should have a name.

286
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:24,473
- What shall I call her?
- Man: <i>Stormbringer.</i>

287
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,642
- Man #2: <i>Terminus.</i>
- Man #3: <i>Widow's Wail.</i>

288
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:29,178
- Man #4: <i>Wolfsbane.</i>
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

289
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,514
( chuckles )

290
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:33,582
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

291
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,251
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

292
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,275
<i>( door opens )</i>

293
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,514
Don't.

294
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,585
You want me on the desk?

295
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:15,257
- <i>What's wrong, my lion?</i>
- Don't call me that.

296
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,994
What should I call you?

297
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:20,963
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

298
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,765
Our friendship?

299
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,167
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

300
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,403
What?

301
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:28,871
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

302
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:33,275
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

303
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:35,978
What is this?

304
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,214
I'm a married man.

305
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:41,117
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

306
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:44,286
<i>I don't want her to suffer anymore</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

307
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,489
I need to uphold my vows.

308
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:49,158
She doesn't want you.

309
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,827
- <i>I need to do right by her.</i>
- You don't want her.

310
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,562
By our children.

311
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,933
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

312
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:01,370
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

313
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,086
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

314
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:07,109
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

315
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,478
- Shae.
- We will fight them together.

316
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,881
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

317
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,016
You're a whore!

318
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:19,255
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

319
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,757
I can't be in love
with a whore.

320
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,193
I can't have children
with a whore.

321
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:26,929
How many men
have you been with?

322
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:29,198
500? 5,000?

323
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:37,506
How many whores
have you been with?

324
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,675
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

325
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,811
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

326
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,146
But now that time
is over.

327
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,019
<i>( Shae crying )</i>

328
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:03,132
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

329
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:08,003
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

330
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:27,923
<i>( door closes )</i>

331
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,965
- <i>( woman screaming )</i>
- Melisandre: Hear us now.

332
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,567
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

333
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,536
and lead us
from the darkness.

334
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,104
( crying )

335
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:44,807
Sire, I served you well.

336
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,776
<i>( crowd chanting )</i>
<i>Lord of Light, show us the way...</i>

337
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:52,214
Selyse, you're my sister!

338
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,782
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

339
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:56,418
Tell him!
Tell him!

340
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,422
<i>for the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

341
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,825
( screaming )

342
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,037
Did you see?
Their souls.

343
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:18,006
It was their souls.

344
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,076
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

345
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,652
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

346
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,954
He was an infidel.

347
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:35,457
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

348
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:37,659
and their fathers
before him.

349
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:40,328
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

350
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:42,664
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

351
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,132
He disobeyed.

352
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:46,468
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

353
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,769
How many men?

354
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:50,172
A good deal
more than you.

355
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,442
Did you see,
Ser Davos?

356
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:54,776
They're with
our lord now.

357
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,345
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

358
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,048
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

359
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:14,296
( sniffs )

360
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,064
Meat's off.

361
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,801
Our larders
are almost empty.

362
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:21,870
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

363
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,472
You hate fish.

364
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,308
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

365
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:31,713
When Storm's End
was under siege and I was starving,

366
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:35,851
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

367
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:38,954
The binding glue
is made from horses.

368
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:46,528
One morning, he shot two seagulls
on the beach.

369
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:50,232
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

370
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:54,002
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

371
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,241
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

372
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:01,476
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child</i>

373
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,678
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

374
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,248
Until he found me.

375
00:24:13,156 --> 00:24:15,390
I fear for
our daughter's soul.

376
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:18,960
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

377
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:21,129
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

378
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:23,265
You barely know her.

379
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,168
You think she's sweet
because she smiles when you visit.

380
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:28,470
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

381
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:31,540
Why else would the Lord of Light have
seen fit to mark her face?

382
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:33,074
She needs the rod.

383
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,578
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

384
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:39,648
As you command.

385
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:44,119
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

386
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:50,425
<i>( knocks )</i>

387
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,528
Come in.

388
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,999
Were you sleeping,
Princess?

389
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:04,973
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

390
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,409
I heard it.

391
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,044
And it frightened you?

392
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:10,946
Ser Axel was my uncle.

393
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,248
<i>He was always</i>
<i>kind to me.</i>

394
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:15,250
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

395
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:18,119
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

396
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:19,754
But they screamed.

397
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,790
Women scream
when they give birth.

398
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,426
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

399
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,127
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

400
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,163
You have so many
questions, don't you?

401
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,398
<i>So did I</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

402
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,767
I was much like you.

403
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,403
Only I wasn't a princess.

404
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,005
And you didn't have this.

405
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,907
No.

406
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,843
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

407
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,279
What do you know
of the gods?

408
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:46,581
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

409
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:49,384
Lies and fables.

410
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:52,454
Septons speak
of seven gods.

411
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:54,055
There are but two--

412
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,458
a god of light
and love and joy

413
00:25:56,492 --> 00:26:00,128
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

414
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:01,897
Eternally at war.

415
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:05,934
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

416
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:09,704
There's only one hell,
Princess.

417
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,908
The one we live in now.

418
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:15,644
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

419
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,437
<i>( growls )</i>

420
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:50,111
- <i>Hodor.</i>
- ( breathing heavily )

421
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:55,417
Why did you wake me?

422
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:58,386
You've been gone
for hours.

423
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:00,055
I was hungry.

424
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,157
We're all hungry.

425
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,892
I was just eating.

426
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:06,962
Summer was eating.

427
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:09,965
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

428
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:13,134
<i>Spending too much time</i>
<i>in Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

429
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,504
You're not
a direwolf, Bran.

430
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:21,443
Must be glorious, though.

431
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:25,146
To run, to leap,
to hunt.

432
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:28,149
To be whole.

433
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,952
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

434
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:33,254
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

435
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,156
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

436
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:41,262
You'd forget us, Bran.

437
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:43,198
You'd forget your mother
and father.

438
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,233
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

439
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,002
You'd forget Winterfell.

440
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:48,937
You'd forget you.

441
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:53,108
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

442
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,913
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

443

<i>( wolf barks )</i>

444

Hodor, take me
to the tree.

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,780

Voice:
<i>...beneath the tree.</i>

449
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,206
- Cersei: <i>He saw us.</i>

( gasps )

453
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:48,189
I know where
we have to go.

454
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:50,959
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

455
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,640
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

456
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:42,544
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

457
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:46,414
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

<i>Cursed be he</i>

459
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:52,353
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

460
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:58,826
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

461
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:04,098
( applause )

462
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,250
We have a new queen.

463
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,187
Better her than you.

464
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,302
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

465
00:31:41,337 --> 00:31:44,472
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

466
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,941
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

467
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,576
tend not to have it
for long.

468
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,813
You ought to try
enjoying something before you die.

469
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:53,414
You might find
it suits you.

470
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:57,085
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

471
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,554
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

472
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:00,955
I'm paying my share.

473
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,291
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

474
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,993
to commemorate
your generosity?

475
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:08,496
No, your heartfelt
thank-you is its own reward.

476
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,499
I would imagine I'd be hearing it
again before long.

477
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,701
Wars are rather expensive.

478
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:16,738
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

479
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:19,507
How they love
to remind everyone.

480
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,210
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

481
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,212
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

482
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,814
We both know
you're smarter than that.

483
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:30,952
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

484
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:35,590
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( people laughing, chatting )

485
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:44,666
All taken care of.

486
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,635
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

487
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,537
You saw the ship
sail away?

488
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:53,207
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

489
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,143
How do you know?

490
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,712
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

491
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:59,480
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

492
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:01,616
There's someone
following you?

493
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:05,019
She's gone.

494
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:07,388
I know you don't
want to believe it, but she is.

495
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:10,758
Now, go drink till it
feels like you did the right thing.

496
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,966
Hello.

497
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:21,502
- Hello.
- Not you.

498
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:39,787
You look
exquisite, child.

499
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:43,124
The wind has been
at you, though.

500
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:46,260
I haven't had
the opportunity to tell you

501
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:49,063
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

502
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:52,633
War is war, but killing a man
at a wedding,

503
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:54,235
horrid.

504
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,504
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

505
00:33:56,538 --> 00:34:00,007
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

506
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,542
My lady.
My lady.

507
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:04,846
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

508
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,547
Perhaps if
your pauper husband

509
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:09,117
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

510
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:12,453
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

511
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:15,523
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

512
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:17,625
it would do you good
to see some of it.

513
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,628
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

514
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,764
some of this food
I paid for.

515
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:29,303
♪ A coat of gold ♪

516
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,006
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

517
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,912
<i>♪ A lion</i>
<i>still has claws ♪</i>

518
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:40,381
♪ And mine,
my lord... ♪

519
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,850
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

520
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:45,686
- ( coins clatter )
- ( crowd laughs )

521
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,303
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

522
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:04,839
( taps goblet )

523
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:06,441
Everyone.

524
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:10,278
The queen would like
to say a few words.

525
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:13,714
( applause )

526
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,654
We are so fortunate

527
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,923
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

528
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,459
Not all among us
are so lucky.

529
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,429
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

530
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:31,766
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

531
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,503
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

532
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:38,773
- ( applause )
- <i>( music playing )</i>

533
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,417
You're an example
to us all.

534
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,668
Ser Jaime,
I'm very sorry.

535
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,370
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

536
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:14,108
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

537
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,676
Loras:
<i>As does yours.</i>

538
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:18,779
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

539
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:21,148
Yes, very much.

540
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:23,551
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

541
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:25,086
They certainly are.

542
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,387
Perhaps they should
get married.

543
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,556
( laughs )

544
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,025
If you were
to marry Cersei,

545
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,660
she'd murder you
in your sleep.

546
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:36,397
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

547
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,566
she'd murder him, too,

548
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,301
long before he drew
his first breath.

549
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:43,437
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

550
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:46,073
because you'll never
marry her.

551
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:51,045
And neither will you.

552
00:37:04,593 --> 00:37:06,727
Your Grace.
My king.

553
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:08,629
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

554
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,932
So good of you to come.

555
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm no lady,
Your Grace.

556
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,835
Did you just bow?

557
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,337
Apologies, Your Grace.

558
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:19,106
I never did master
the curtsy.

559
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:20,741
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

560
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,744
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

561
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:25,479
A shame.

562
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:28,149
I'd knight the man that put an end
to that deviant's life.

563
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:31,452
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

564
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:32,853
and wish you good fortune.

565
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,789
The country has been
at war too long.

566
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:38,059
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

567
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:39,894
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

568
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:42,129
I hope we see
more of you.

569
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:50,972
Lady Brienne.

570
00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:53,841
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

571
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,844
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

572
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:59,146
As you say, Your Grace.

573
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:00,615
I owe you my gratitude.

574
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:02,950
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

575
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,788
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

576
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:09,557
More than once.

577
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:11,692
Did he?

578
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:14,362
Haven't heard
that story before.

579
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:18,566
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

580
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,968
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

581
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:25,106
Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

582
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,643
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

583
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:31,445
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

584
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,015
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

585
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:36,183
But you love him.

586
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:46,160
Your Grace.

587
00:38:56,705 --> 00:39:00,741
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

588
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:03,044
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

589
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:05,246
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice--

590
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,981
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

591
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:10,117
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

592
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:13,554
Brought shame on the Citadel with his
repugnant experiments.

593
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,923
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

594
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:18,325
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

595
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,162
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

596
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:23,276
What do you think
I could do to you if you annoyed me?

597
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,266
I never meant
to annoy anyone.

598
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,202
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

599
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,404
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

600
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,939
So here's what I want
you to do.

601
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,507
I want you to leave
my presence.

602
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:34,975
Leave this wedding
right now.

603
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,644
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

604
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:40,114
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

605
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,383
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery--

606
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,752
The <i>queen</i> is telling you

607
00:39:44,786 --> 00:39:47,054
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

608
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:49,323
or you will.

609
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,145
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

610
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,414
( crowd laughing )

611
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:24,959
You're in rather
a good mood.

612
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:27,294
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

613
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,531
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

614
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,099
Prince Oberyn.

615
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:33,467
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

616
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:35,236
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

617
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,671
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

618
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,407
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

619
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:43,844
Lord Hand
and Lady Cersei,

620
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:47,915
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

621
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,650
Charmed.

622
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:51,852
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

623
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:57,224
We are everywhere in Dorne.

624
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,593
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

625
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:02,062
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

626
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:03,497
We don't despise them
in Dorne.

627
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:04,732
No?
How tolerant of you.

628
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,801
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

629
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,537
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

630
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:12,706
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

631
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,742
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

632
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,710
It's a shame your older brother couldn't
attend the wedding.

633
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:19,079
Please give him
our regards.

634
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:20,848
With any luck,
the gout will abate

635
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:22,516
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

636
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,451
They call it
the rich man's disease.

637
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:25,853
A wonder
you don't have it.

638
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,755
Noblemen in my part
of the country

639
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,858
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

640
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:32,760
People everywhere
have their differences.

641
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:35,996
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

Though you're not
