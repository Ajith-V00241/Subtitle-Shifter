I have created a subtitle shifter app.
program name is "subShifterApp.rb"

COMMAND TO RUN: ruby subShifterApp.rb <option> "<second,millisecond>"
	OPTIONS : left, right
	eg: ruby subShifterApp.rb left "99,220"
The name of the input SUBTITLE(.srt) is hardcoded as "gg.srt"
The output file is generated as "output.srt"
